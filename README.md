# Bitguana

## Project Structure

### Getting Started
    
This project was bootstrapped with Nuxt3 Vue Framework using a TypeScript.
Core packages and libraries are nuxt3, vue3 and TailwindCSS3.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev

```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# yarn
yarn build
```

### Run with Node.js Server

When running nuxt build with the Node server preset, the result will be an entry point that launches a ready-to-run Node server.

```bash
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

This will launch your production Nuxt server that listens on port 3000 by default.

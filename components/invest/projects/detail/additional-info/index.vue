                    Overview of Transaction. The global wine industry, aged more than 2’000 years and valued more than USD 300B has already significant challenges that Winessy is about to revolutionize. Winessy primarily introduces wine blockchain, offering to the consumers a full account of wine quality and its track record through real uneditable data collected during the winemaking process. Winessy tokenizes, using blockchain technology, both “wine futures”, and bottled wine, offering NFT for buyers and investors. The prime wine product is derived from high-quality Grand Cru wines, already pre-stocked by Winessy and affiliated wineries around the Bordeaux area of France.

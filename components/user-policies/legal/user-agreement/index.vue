                </span><br><br>
                1.1.The user (“User”, as defined in clause 2.6 below )
agrees to be bound by this user agreement (“User
Agreement”, as defined in clause 2.1 below) by accepting
and / or using the platform (the “Platform”, as defined in
clause 2.2 below), and / or the Services (the “Services”, as
defined in clause 2.9 below), and / or by executing the loan
agreement (“Loan Agreement”, as defined in clause 2.27
below) with the operator (“Operator”, as defined in clause
2.4 below).<br><br>

1.2. By using the information available at the Platform
and / or its Services, and by visiting the Platform, You hereby
declare and confirm that You have thoroughly familiarised
Yourself with the this User Agreement, and that You have
read and understood the content of each provision and
consequences thereof, and that You understand and accept
that this User Agreement is a legally binding document
without coercion, persuasion or exertion of other influence.
<br><br>
1.3. The User hereby additionally confirms that this
User Agreement fully corresponds to the User’s true
intentions and will, and that the User is not using the
Platform and / or any of its Services, nor is the User reading
this User Agreement under the influence of alcohol,
narcotic, psychotropic or other psychoactive substances.
<br><br>
1.4. The User also understands and accepts that the
User is not only able to, but also encouraged by the Operator
to consult independent legal and financial advisers
regarding the interpretation and execution of this User
Agreement and the Services that the Platform provides.
<br><br>
1.5. A User who does not accept this User Agreement
is not authorised by the Operator to use the Platform and /
or the Services.
<br><br>
1.6. This User Agreement regulates the terms and
conditions for the use of the Platform, and the legal
relationship between the User and the Operator, as well as
between the registered users of the Platform (“Registered
Users”, as defined in clause 1.2.6 below).
<br><br>
1.7. The Platform in its entirety and the intellectual
rights to its content shall belong to the Operator. The User
shall not have the right to save, copy, modify, relocate,
transfer or disclose the content of the Platform and the
Platform’s website (“Website”, as defined in clause 2.3
below).
<br><br>
1.8. The Platform is administered and made available
to the public by the Operator, and through the Platform, the
Operator intermediates between Registered Users wishing
to borrow, and Registered Users willing to invest in loan,
credit or any other debt investment opportunities . Through
the Platform, the Operator also provides the means to
conclude the electronic agreements necessary between the
parties to each transaction in which the Operator intermediates. However, the User hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the interest rate (“Interest”, as defined in clause
2.35 below) and / or any other potential benefits indicated
on the loan offers (“Loan Offer”, as defined in clause Error! Reference source not found.) published on the Platform are
not guaranteed, may change independent of the Operator’s
will, and cannot be deemed to be investment advice or
counsel by the Operator. The Operator does not provide any
guarantee to the User that the Loan Offers published in the
Platform will be repaid according to the terms and
conditions therein displayed. The Operator seeks to
reasonably evaluate credit risk and improve the risk model
applicable for each loan application (“Application”, as
defined in clause 2.14 below), but the Operator does not
assume liability for any loss incurred by the User if the loan
amount (“Loan Amount”, as defined in clause 2.29 below)
and / or any other amounts invested by the User through
the Platform have not been repaid. The User agrees to
assume the credit risk at the User’s own free will when
investing or lending through the Platform. The User
acknowledges that the role of the Operator is just that of an
intermediary introducing the Registered Users to each other
and providing certain specific information and / or other
complementary services to enable the transactions between
the Registered Users. The User therefore agrees to
indemnify the Operator, its employees, representatives and
beneficiaries, and any of the Operator’s affiliated companies
and / or associates, for any and all losses incurred as a result
of the User’s actions, decisions or transactions while using
the Platform or the information displayed on it.
<br><br>
1.9. Information and data displayed on the Loan Offers
published at the Platform are provided by the Registered
Users, and therefore, the Operator shall not be held
responsible for the correctness and / or validity of any of the
information displayed on the Loan Offers or on the Platform,
and You have no right to claim or request compensation for
any liabilities or losses You may incur into, due to Your own
actions, decisions or transactions while using the
information provided on the Platform.
